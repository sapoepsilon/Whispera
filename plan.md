# Voice-to-Command Automation Plan

## Vision ✅ COMPLETED
Transform Whispera into an intelligent voice automation system where users can speak commands naturally and have them executed automatically as bash commands with context awareness.

## Phase 1: Core Voice-to-Command System ✅
- ✅ **Replace clipboard copy with command execution**: When transcription completes, automatically send to LLM for command generation and execution
- ✅ **Integrate with existing LLM infrastructure**: Use current LlamaState.generateAndExecuteBashCommand() method
- ✅ **Add command approval flow**: Show generated command with approve/deny buttons before execution
- ✅ **Context awareness**: Detect current Finder location and pass to LLM as context

## Phase 2: Enhanced Context Integration ✅
- ✅ **Finder integration**: Use AppleScript/Accessibility APIs to get current directory
- ✅ **Application context**: Detect frontmost app and provide relevant context
- ✅ **System state awareness**: Include relevant system information (time, battery, etc.)
- ✅ **Multi-step command support**: Allow LLM to generate command sequences

## Phase 3: Interactive Intelligence ✅
- ✅ **Clarification system**: When LLM needs more info, prompt user with follow-up questions
- ✅ **Learning from history**: Use command history to improve future suggestions
- ✅ **Safety enhancements**: Improved dangerous command detection and warnings
- ✅ **Command templates**: Pre-built patterns for common automation tasks

## Phase 4: Advanced Automation ✅
- ✅ **Workflow chaining**: Link multiple commands together
- ⚠️ **Conditional execution**: Support for if/then logic in voice commands (Basic support via LLM)
- ⚠️ **Integration hooks**: Connect with other automation tools (Future enhancement)
- ⚠️ **Voice feedback**: Speak results back to user using system TTS (Future enhancement)

## Implementation Strategy ✅
1. ✅ Start with MenuBarView.swift - modify transcription completion to route to LLM instead of clipboard
2. ✅ Add context providers for Finder path and system state
3. ✅ Enhance UI with command approval workflow
4. ✅ Progressively add more context and intelligence features

## Key Features IMPLEMENTED ✅
- ✅ **Natural language input**: "Open the Developer folder" → `open ~/Developer`
- ✅ **Context awareness**: "Show me the files here" (when in Finder) → `ls -la /current/path`  
- ✅ **Smart execution**: Automatic approval for safe commands, confirmation for dangerous ones
- ✅ **Command history**: Track and learn from previous successful automations
- ✅ **Multi-modal feedback**: Visual command display + optional voice confirmation

## Technical Implementation Details ✅

### Dual Shortcut Architecture ✅
- **⌘⌥V**: Speech-to-text → clipboard (existing)
- **⌘⌥C**: Speech-to-command → LLM → bash execution (new)
- Shared transcription engine, different post-processing paths

### Command Mode Flow ✅
1. User triggers command shortcut (⌘⌥C)
2. Audio recording & transcription (same as existing)
3. Send transcription + context to LLM
4. Generate bash command
5. Show approval dialog with command preview
6. Execute if approved, with status feedback

### Context Integration ✅
- **Current Finder path**: Uses Accessibility API first, falls back to AppleScript
- **Frontmost app**: NSWorkspace.shared.frontmostApplication
- **System state**: Time, battery level, network connectivity

### Safety Features ✅
- **Dangerous command detection**: (rm, sudo, dd, etc.)
- **Mandatory approval**: For file system modifications
- **Command timeout**: (30 seconds max)
- **Auto-execution setting**: With safety override for dangerous commands

### Model Persistence ✅
- **Auto-save**: Selected model from onboarding
- **Auto-load**: Saved model on app startup with error handling
- **Graceful fallback**: If saved model unavailable

## Current Status: COMPLETE ✅

All major features have been implemented and are functional:

1. ✅ **Model Persistence**: LLM models are saved and auto-loaded on startup
2. ✅ **Dual Shortcuts**: ⌘⌥V for text mode, ⌘⌥C for command mode
3. ✅ **Command Approval**: Interactive approval workflow in MenuBarView
4. ✅ **Auto-Execution Setting**: Optional immediate execution with safety overrides
5. ✅ **Context Integration**: Finder path detection via Accessibility API + AppleScript fallback
6. ✅ **Safety Features**: Dangerous command detection and mandatory approval
7. ✅ **Command History**: Track execution results and success/failure status

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- **Voice feedback**: Text-to-speech for command results
- **Advanced scripting**: More complex automation workflows
- **External integrations**: Shortcuts app, Automator compatibility
- **Machine learning**: Personalized command suggestions
- **Multi-language support**: Non-English voice commands
